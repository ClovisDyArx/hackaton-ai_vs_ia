He often used these techniques to create a sense of density and complexity in his music.\\\\n\\\\nGyörgy Ligeti: Ligeti was a Hungarian-Austrian composer who was known for his use of sound mass techniques in his music.

He often used these techniques to create a sense of density and complexity in his compositions.\\\\n\\\\nJohn Adams: Adams is an American composer who has also used sound mass techniques in his music.

       " 'Sound mass is a compositional technique that involves the use of dense clusters of sound to create a harmonically and timbrally rich texture. It was first developed by the French composer Edgard Varèse in the early 20th century and has been used by many other composers since then. Some other composers who have used sound mass in their works include Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti, and Iannis Xenakis.',\n",
       " 'The term \"sound mass\" refers to a musical texture characterized by a dense, homogeneous sound that is created through the layering of many different pitches and timbres. This technique has been used by a number of composers in various musical styles, including classical, experimental, and electronic music.\\\\n\\\\nOne well-known composer who made extensive use of sound mass in his music is Gyorgy Ligeti. Ligeti was a Hungarian composer who was associated with the avant-garde movement in the mid-20th century. He is perhaps best known for his use of micropolyphony, which involves the layering of multiple independent lines of music that create a dense, complex texture. Many of Ligeti\\'s works, including his piano etudes and his chamber music, feature extensive use of sound mass.\\\\n\\\\nOther composers who have made use of sound mass in their music include Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Sound mass is also a common technique in electronic and experimental music, where it is often created using synthesizers and other electronic sound-generating devices.']"
